 *  is a double. A double is kind of like a number, but bigger and better. However, like the previous two variables (see above - you probably get the idea), this 
 *  variable does not have any default value associated with it, which, frankly, if you ask me, makes it a rather shoddy sort of variable. I mean really, 
 *  what good is a variable if you don’t store anything in it? That’s like a magic chest with nothing in it!*/

For further information about the first four variables, please see above. For further information about the secret fifth variable, knowledge of which, if properly harnessed, will allow you to see beyond the flimsy abstraction of “code” and “compiler”, and allow you to write instructions directly to the universal terminal, you must first go the deepest cave in Kentucky, and become comfortable in the darkness.
