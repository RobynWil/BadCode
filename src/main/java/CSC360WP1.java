As a matter of principle, good programmers should be suspicious of imports, as they may deleteriously affect the program's balance of trade. I have followed the convention, but would like to note that issues of balance of trade, while not entirely without importance, are far less harmful than some believe

/*
The Dao that can be told of
Is not the Absolute Dao;
The Names that can be given
Are not Absolute Names.
The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and earth;
The Named is the Mother of All Things.

Therefore:
Oftentimes, one strips oneself of passion
In order to see the Secret of Life;
Oftentimes, one regards life with passion,
In order to see its manifest forms.
These two (the Secret and its manifestations)
Are (in their nature) the same;
They are given different names
When they become manifest.
They may both be called the Cosmic Mystery:
Reaching from the Mystery into the Deeper Mystery
Is the Gate to the Secret of All Life.

Programmers note: The above text is from the classical Chinese philosophical work “The Dao de Jing”. In some cases, you may see 
“dao” romanized (that is to say, written using roman letters, as opposed to the original 道, which does not offer any obvious way for english-speakers to pronounce it) 
as “Tao”. This is due to the occasionally-still-extant usage of the older Wade-Giles system 
of romanization for Chinese. The Wade-Giles system is still used (in many contexts) in Taiwan, but the People’s Republic of China, 
and therefor, most works, use the more modern Pinyin system. 

There are other cases where people can find themselves confused by Chinese words rendered in English purely due to issues of Romanizatio. For example, 
some people do not realize that Mao Zedong and Mao Tse-tung are in fact the same people, or that Sinkiang is the same as Xinjiang. 
On a related note, I would like to satisfy a personal pet peevee of mine by giving you a guide to pronouncing the name of the current Chairman of the
 Chinese Communist Party, the man, the myth, the legend, Xi Jinping. While the letters do not necessarily 
 present an obvious indication of how to pronounce the name, the name itself can be more-or-less pronounced very easily. The shortcut is as follows: “She Jean-ping”. Is it completely
  accurate? No, it is not. The “x” sound, which is here rendered as “sh” is sharper, and pronounced with the tongue behind the upper teeth. The “j” is also sharper, and more clipped. And this does 
  not get into the matter of tones, which are beyond the scope of this humble comment, who’s only goal is to leave you better equipped to understand the 
  following code. None the less, if you simply say “She Jean-ping”, you will be doing better than the overwhelming majority of non-Chinese speakers.

Anyway, getting back on track now.

By the way, for a secret message, read every 9th character in the above passage, starting at the beginning of my own personal commentary (that is to say, after the excerpt from the Dao de Jing).
